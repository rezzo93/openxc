Equations that will be used

Instantaneous MPG

**Note, this is dependent upon on the sensitivity (precision) of the odometer and fuel reading

(Current odometer reading-last refresh odometer reading)/(Current fuel consumed s.restart-last refresh fuel consumed)


Total trip MPG

(Current odometer reading-initial odometer reading during ignition)/(Current fuel consumed since restart-0)


Types of plots

	Instantaneous MPG vs. time a plot of 
	Velocity vs. time
	Accelerator pedal position vs. time

All of the plots will be compared to each another. We will need to test the signals to see the loss.
